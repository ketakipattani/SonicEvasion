# SonicEvasion
This project aims at attacking the user privacy using Evasion and Covert Channels. Evasive Techniques used are PCEUA(Prime Composite Evasive Ultrasonic Attack) and FLEII(File Lock based Evasive Information Invasion). Existing Reed Solomon library is used as a base of sound generation, though many changes are made in it.
